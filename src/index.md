<p>
    Hello there! My name's Ed Millington. I'm a front-end developer based in Christchurch, New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
    This is a great place to find out more <a href="/pages/about-me">about me</a> and my work (if you're pressed for time, you can cut out the waffle and download <a href="/assets/ed-millington-cv.pdf" target="blank">my cv</a> directly!)
</p>
<p>
    My <a href="/pages/virtual-bookshelf" title="my virtual bookshelf">virtual bookshelf</a> — a list of all the books I've read since 2021 — is also hosted here. It is a vue app which uses pinia to store data grabbed via graphQL. The source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mllngtn/edmill-11ty/tree/main/src/js/readingList" title="my github account" target="blank">github account</a>.
